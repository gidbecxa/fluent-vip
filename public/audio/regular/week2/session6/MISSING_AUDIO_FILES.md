# Missing Audio Files for Session 6

The following audio files are referenced in the session content but need to be created:

## Key Phrases Audio Files
- `i-have-brown-eyes.mp3`
- `you-have-blue-hair.mp3`
- `i-have-glasses.mp3`
- `do-you-have-long-hair.mp3`
- `i-dont-have-green-eyes.mp3`

## Dialogue Practice Audio Files
- `dialogue-line1.mp3` (for "Look, this is my new profile picture.")

## Grammar Comparison Audio Files
- `i-am-tall.mp3` (for "I am tall." example)

## Note
The AudioPlayer component is designed to handle missing audio files gracefully by:
1. Showing a loading state initially
2. Disabling the play button if the audio fails to load
3. Not breaking the user experience if audio files are missing

These audio files should be recorded and added before production deployment.
